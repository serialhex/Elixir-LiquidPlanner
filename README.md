# Elixir & LiquidPlanner

An interface to the LiquidPlanner API via Elixir.

This is my first Elixir lib, (and I'm fairly new to Elixir itself), so please
excuse any big mistakes & help with bugfixes / features (or at least bug reports
and feature requests).

## Installation

**NOT YET AVAILABLE IN HEX!!!!**

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `liquidplanner` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:liquidplanner, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/liquidplanner](https://hexdocs.pm/liquidplanner).
